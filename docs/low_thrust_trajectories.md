This tutorial shows how to convert trajectories coming from ASTRA into low-thrust. It has to be said that ASTRA is currently able to convert solutions by solving a time-fixed fuel-optimal optimal control problem. Many references are available, but the main ones that inspired us are [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2).
