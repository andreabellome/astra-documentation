# `costFunction1_MODP_vdep`

## DESCRIPTION
This function computes two cost objectives for a given set of trajectory legs
and determines the subset of solutions that form the Pareto front.

## INPUT
- legn  : matrix containing trajectory leg parameters, where columns represent
different trajectory characteristics such as departure time, arrival
time, and delta-v components.
- vvf   : matrix containing final velocity vectors for each trajectory leg.
- vinff : matrix containing incoming hyperbolic excess velocities.
- vdep  : scalar value representing the initial departure velocity.
- sigma : weighting factor for the time-of-flight in the total cost computation.

## OUTPUT
- legn  : subset of the input legn matrix corresponding to the Pareto-optimal solutions.
- vvf   : subset of the input vvf matrix corresponding to the Pareto-optimal solutions.
- vinff : subset of the input vinff matrix corresponding to the Pareto-optimal solutions.

## PROCESS
1. Compute the departure delta-v (dv1), ensuring non-negative values.
2. Compute the total time-of-flight (tofs) in years.
3. Compute the total delta-v (dvtot) including all intermediate maneuvers.
4. Formulate the cost matrix using time-of-flight and total delta-v weighted by sigma.
5. Compute the Pareto front using the `paretoFront_MODP` function.
6. Extract and return only the Pareto-optimal solutions.
