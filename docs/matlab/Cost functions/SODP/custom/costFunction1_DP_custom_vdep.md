# `costFunction1_DP_custom_vdep`

## DESCRIPTION
This function selects the optimal trajectory based on a cost function that
considers both delta-v and time-of-flight. It returns the trajectory leg,
final velocity, and incoming hyperbolic excess velocity corresponding to
the minimum cost.

## INPUT
- legn  : matrix containing trajectory leg parameters, where columns represent
different trajectory characteristics such as departure time, arrival
time, and delta-v components.
- vvf   : matrix containing final velocity vectors for each trajectory leg.
- vinff : matrix containing incoming hyperbolic excess velocities.
- vdep  : scalar value representing the specified departure velocity.
- sigma : weighting factor for the time-of-flight in the total cost computation.

## OUTPUT
- legn  : row vector corresponding to the optimal trajectory leg.
- vvf   : row vector corresponding to the final velocity of the optimal trajectory.
- vinff : row vector corresponding to the incoming excess velocity of the optimal trajectory.

## PROCESS
1. Compute the departure delta-v (dv1), ensuring non-negative values.
2. Compute the total time-of-flight (tofs).
3. Compute the total delta-v (dvtot) including all intermediate maneuvers.
4. Normalize the time-of-flight in years.
5. Compute the total cost as the sum of delta-v and weighted time-of-flight.
6. Identify the trajectory with the minimum total cost.
7. Return the corresponding trajectory leg, final velocity, and incoming excess velocity.
