# `costFunction2_DP_custom_vdep_varr`

## DESCRIPTION
This function computes the total cost of a trajectory based on delta-v and
time-of-flight, incorporating departure and arrival velocity constraints.
It identifies the minimum-cost trajectory among the given options.

## INPUT
- legn  : matrix containing trajectory leg parameters, where columns represent
different trajectory characteristics such as departure time, arrival
time, and delta-v components.
- vvf   : matrix containing final velocity vectors for each trajectory leg.
- vinff : matrix containing incoming hyperbolic excess velocities.
- vdep  : scalar value representing the specified departure velocity.
- varr  : scalar value representing the specified arrival velocity.
- sigma : weighting factor for the time-of-flight in the total cost computation.

## OUTPUT
- minCOST : minimum total cost among all trajectories.
- row     : index of the trajectory with the minimum cost.
- COSTS   : vector containing the total cost for each trajectory.
- TOFYS   : vector containing the time-of-flight in years for each trajectory.

## PROCESS
1. Compute the departure delta-v (dv1), ensuring non-negative values.
2. Compute the arrival delta-v (dv2), ensuring non-negative values.
3. Compute the total time-of-flight (tofs) in years.
4. Compute the total delta-v (dvtot) including all intermediate maneuvers.
5. Compute the total cost as the sum of delta-v and weighted time-of-flight.
6. Identify the trajectory with the minimum total cost.

## Function Signature
