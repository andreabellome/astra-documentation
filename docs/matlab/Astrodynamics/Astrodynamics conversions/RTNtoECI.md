# `RTNtoECI`

## DESCRIPTION
This function converts a vector from the RTN (Radial, Transverse, Normal)
frame to the ECI (Earth-Centered Inertial) frame by constructing the
transformation matrix based on the input position and velocity vectors.

## INPUT
- rr : Position vector in the ECI frame (3x1 vector).
- vv : Velocity vector in the ECI frame (3x1 vector).

## OUTPUT
- rtn2eci : 3x3 transformation matrix to convert a vector from the RTN
frame to the ECI frame.

## Function Signature
```matlab
[rtn2eci] = RTNtoECI(rr,vv)
```
