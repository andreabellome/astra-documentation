# Welcome to ASTRA! 🚀

ASTRA (Automatic Swing-by TRAjectories) is a MATLAB-based toolbox for optimally building multi-gravity assist (MGA) trajectories. This has been built as a result of Andrea Bellome's Ph.D. thesis [[1]](#1). ASTRA is based on Dynamic Programming (DP) to optimize MGA trajectories, both in single-objective (SODP) and multi-objective (MODP) variant.
